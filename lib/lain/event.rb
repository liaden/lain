module Lain
  # Structured events that flow through a {Lain::Channel}.
  #
  # Every event is a small, deeply frozen `Data` value object: two events with
  # equal attributes are equal (`Regular` in the project's algebra), and nothing
  # about an event can mutate after construction, so it is safe to share across
  # threads without copying. Equality, `#hash`, and immutability come from `Data`
  # itself; {Journalable} adds the one behaviour they share — serializing to a
  # tagged JSON object for the {Lain::Journal}.
  module Event
    # The NDJSON self-description every event owes the {Lain::Journal}. Mixed into
    # each `Data` event: its journal form is its attributes plus a `type` tag that
    # lets a reader discriminate the record without inspecting its shape. The
    # Journal adds durability and a timestamp; an event only has to describe
    # itself.
    module Journalable
      # @return [Hash{String=>Object}] the attributes, string-keyed, tagged.

    # stream of these, so provenance is captured at the source rather than
    # reconstructed later. `tool_use_id`/`bytes` are frozen at construction
    # because `Data` freezes the instance but not a contained mutable String, and
    # one unfrozen ivar would make the event non-`Ractor.shareable?`.
